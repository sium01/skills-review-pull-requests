# Review pull requests

_Collaborate efficiently and improve your code by reviewing pull requests on GitHub._

</header>

## 🧭 Course Overview

This course will guide you through creating and reviewing pull requests — one of the core collaboration features on GitHub. You'll learn how to propose changes, give and receive feedback, and merge contributions into the main project.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Open a Pull Request

👋 _Welcome to "Review pull requests"!_

We’ll begin by opening a pull request (PR). PRs are how developers collaborate. When you make changes in a branch, you open a PR to propose those changes to be merged into the `main` branch.

📘 _Want to know more?_  
Learn about [pull requests on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).

### 📝 Activity: Create a Pull Request

Follow these steps to create a pull request from your feature branch:

1. Click the **Pull requests** tab in your repository.
2. Select **New pull request**.
3. Under the **base** dropdown, ensure it's set to `main`.
4. Under **compare**, choose the branch you’ve been working on, e.g., `update-game`.
5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Add a title:  
   `Update the game over message`
7. Add a description:  
   `Improved the game over message to provide clearer replay instructions.`
8. Click **Create pull request**.

✅ After creating the PR, wait around 20 seconds, then refresh this page to see the next step. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will take care of progressing your course.
